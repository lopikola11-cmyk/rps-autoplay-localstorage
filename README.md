# Rock Paper Scissors with Autoplay & Local Storage

🔗 Live Demo: https://lopikola11-cmyk.github.io/rps-autoplay-localstorage/

This game is built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
It supports both **manual play** and **autoplay mode**, tracks scores using **LocalStorage**, and maintains them across page loads.
